# Log-in-Report-Generator
A Python script that tracks and reports user login activity across machines. It defines an Event class to capture system events, sorts and processes login/logout data, and generates a clear report showing which users are currently active on each machine. Useful for monitoring system usage and detecting inconsistencies in login sessions.
